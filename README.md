# Deep-Learning-Projects
Completed Deep Learning Projects

Mainly Usd packages:
      machine learning: Numpy,scikitlearn, tensorflow, keras
      image processing: PIL/pillow, openCV
      NLP: nltk

1. data extraction and procssing: image/text preprocessing, word embeding (Word2vec & GloVe)
2. deep learning models:deep NN, CNN (ResNet, Inception, R-CNN,YOLO), RNN (GRU, LSTM)
3. structures/techniques: autoencoder, GANs, transfer learning
4. Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization: 
   Train/Dev/Test sets splitting, Bias/Variance
   L1/L2 regularization, dropout, batch-normalization
   GD, RMSProp,Adam, etc
